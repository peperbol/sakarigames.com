	<history>
Foreign Legion was the debute title of Sakari Games. First released as a one level game it was updated as promised to a more mission based game. In the first version all weapons were available from the start. After the update a leveling system was introduced that would unlock the weapons. Boxed versions of the game were available in Germany, Poland and Russia. For a short period the game also was embeded into a Belgium social platform.
